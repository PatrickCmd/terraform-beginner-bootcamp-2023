        <div class="step">
            <h3>Step 1: Join the Underground Races</h3>
            <img src="assets/nfs-mostwanted-1.jpeg" alt="Underground Racing Image">
            
            <p>
                In the heart of Rockport City, a neon-lit underground racing scene thrived. 
                It was here that the pursuit of speed and the roar of engines echoed through the winding streets. 
                Our story begins with Alex Turner, an aspiring racer with a relentless desire to prove himself on the unforgiving asphalt. 
                With his trusty BMW M3 GTR in tow, Alex was ready to embark on a journey that would take him from an unknown contender to the Most Wanted.

            <p>
                The path to notoriety began with the accumulation of "bounties," the currency of the underground racing world. 
                Alex had to win races to earn these bounties and, in doing so, build his reputation. 
                From exhilarating "Sprint" races that tested his speed on the city's chaotic streets to grueling "Circuit" 
                races where he had to dominate his competition lap after lap, every victory increased his bounties.

            <h3>Step 3: The Blacklist Challenge</h3>

            <p>
                To make a name for himself, Alex needed to take on the Blacklist. 
                This exclusive group of elite racers was notorious for their skills and rebellious spirit. 
                To challenge them, he had to prove his worth by accumulating a substantial bounty. 
                Defeating each Blacklist member was a stepping stone to climbing the ranks.

            <p>
                In the underground racing world, reputation and pride were tied to the high-performance cars they drove. 
                Alex participated in intense "Pink Slip" races, where the stakes were high. 
                Winning meant taking ownership of his rival's prized vehicles, and losing could mean parting with his own. 
                It was a gamble that added more pressure to the already intense races.

            <h3>Step 5: Climbing the Blacklist</h3>

            <p>
                Each Blacklist member had their unique style and personality, making every race a battle not just of speed but of strategy. 
                As Alex defeated these racers one by one, he climbed the Blacklist rankings. With every victory, his reputation soared, 
                and he earned the respect of the underground racing community.

            <p>
                The final Blacklist member, Razor, held the coveted top spot. 
                To challenge him, Alex had to prove he was the ultimate racer. 
                The showdown was an adrenaline-fueled clash of titans, testing Alex's skills to the limit.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 7: The Ultimate Victory</h3>
            <img src="assets/nfs-mostwanted-7.jpeg" alt="Victory Image" width="300px">
            <p>
                In a heart-pounding final battle, Alex emerged victorious against Razor, claiming the number one spot and earning the title of the Most Wanted. 
                But with the glory came the unwanted attention of Rockport City's relentless police force, and Alex had to make a daring escape, leaving the city 
                behind as a legend on the streets of Rockport.
                As the city continued to thrive with new racers seeking their place on the Blacklist, Alex Turner, the Most Wanted, had already set his sights 
                on new horizons, constantly chasing the thrill of the race and the next big challenge.
